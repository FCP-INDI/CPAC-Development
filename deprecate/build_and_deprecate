# This script takes a tag ($TAG) from https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/fcpindi/c-pac/tags, and does the following:
#   1. creates an image tagged ${TAG}-DEPRECATED with the same contents as the given tag except also printing the text in `CRITICAL_ALERT.rst` when the image is run and adding a copy to the log directory of each run generated by the image,
#   2. replaces that tag with an image that only prints the text in `CRITICAL_ALERT.rst`, and
#   3. pushes both images to Docker Hub, overwriting any existing images with the same name.
#
# Usage: ./build_and_deprecate $DEPRECATED_TAG
